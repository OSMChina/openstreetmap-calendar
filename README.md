# OpenStreetMap Calendar

A simple calendar for tracking OpenStreetMap related activities, so we don't have to wrestle the wiki anymore.

This is a Django application, it uses [pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/en/latest/) for managing dependencies. See their manual for setup instructions.

## Principles

* Less, but better.
